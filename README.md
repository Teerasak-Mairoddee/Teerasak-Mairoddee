## Hi, I'm Teerasak Mairoddee

A self-taught cybersecurity student and developer from the UK, building secure systems, offensive tooling, and practical solutions to real-world problems. My journey blends five years of high-performance sales with hands-on security research, offensive development, and impactful side projects that are already making waves in the workplace.

### What I Do

- **Cybersecurity Projects**: From hardware-based HID attacks using Raspberry Pi Zero to custom-built logging systems that track and visualise strike rates, I'm building tools that mirror real-world attack vectors and improve operational decision-making.
- **Full-Stack Web Development**: PHP, Node.js, React, and Chart.js power my dashboards and internal apps. I focus on security-first development with features like role-based access, input sanitisation, and server-side API calls.
- **Red Teaming & Pentesting Practice**: Active on TryHackMe, building my own detection labs and testing environments. I write scripts to simulate attacks and study how systems fail, all while preparing for the **CompTIA PenTest+** certification.
- **DevSecOps Approach**: Interested in integrating secure coding into the CI/CD pipeline. My goal is to bridge offensive security knowledge with defensive coding best practices.

### Tech Stack & Tools

- **Languages**: PHP, JavaScript (Node.js, React), Python, Bash
- **Cybersecurity**: Kali Linux, Burp Suite, Metasploit, Nmap, Wireshark, HID attacks, Raspberry Pi labs
- **Tools**: Git, Docker, PM2, Chart.js, ClamAV, VS Code, Postman
- **Other Skills**: Sales strategy, user training, project leadership, financial awareness

### Side Projects That Drive Results

- **Currys Tally App**: A full-stack sales tracking and performance tool used in-store. Features include strike rate logic, data visualisation, user authentication, admin-only controls, and insurance tracking logic â€” all built after hours.
- **Cover Letter Generator**: An AI-powered CV and job match tool built to help applicants break into tech â€” including prompt injection prevention and secure server-side logic.
- **Hardware Exploitation Toolkit**: Set up a lab to simulate physical-layer attacks using Raspberry Pi Zero, P4wnP1 HID injection, and USB emulation.

### ðŸŽ¯ My Goal

I'm looking to join a security-focused team where I can apply my offensive and defensive knowledge to build safer systems, grow fast, and deliver value. Whether it's a SOC, GRC role, or junior pentester position, I bring energy, adaptability, and a sharp eye for risk.
